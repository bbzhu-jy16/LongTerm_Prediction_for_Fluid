# Learning High-Performance Long-term Temporal Evolution for Fluid Flow

### Install Mantaflow first
This installation guide focusses on Ubuntu 14.04 as a distribution. The process will however look very similar with other distributions, the main differences being the package manager and library package names.

First, install a few pre-requisites:

`sudo apt-get install cmake g++ git python3-dev qt5-qmake qt5-default`

Then, change to the directory to install the source code in, and obtain the current sources from the repository (or alternatively download and extract a source code package)

`cd <gitdir>`

To build the project using CMake, set up a build directory and choose the build options (explanation)

`mkdir mantaflow/build`

`cd mantaflow/build`

`cmake .. -DGUI=ON -DOPENMP=ON -DNUMPY=ON -DPYTHON_VERSION=3.6`

`make -j4`

That's it! You can now test mantaflow using an example scene

`./manta ../scenes/examples/simpleplume.py`

Common Linux problems:

- In conjunction with tensorflow, it can easily happen these days that you have multiple version of python installed. If cmake for mantaflow finds a different one than you're using for tensorflow, you will get errors such as ''ImportError: no module named XXX''. To fix this problem, manually select a python version in cmake with -DPYTHON_VERSION=X.Y
- It is also possible to directly specify the directory in which the python installation resides as follows:
    - `DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/PATH/TO/PYTHONENV/include/python3.6m `
    - `DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/PATH/TO/PYTHONENV/lib/libpython3.6m.so`

Further information on the installation process can be found on the project website http://mantaflow.com/.
